The first step is to configure the necessary Gradle dependencies. This basically means adding a dependency on the http://plugins.grails.org/plugin/rxjava[RxJava plugin] for Grails and Micronaut `reactivex`in the `build.gradle` file:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    ...
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tags=rxjava]
}

----

RxJava is used to facilitate a reactive programming model for sending events to the JavaScript client.
