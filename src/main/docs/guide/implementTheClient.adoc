To implement the client first open up the `grails-app/index.gsp` file and add an additional header below the "Welcome to Grails" `<h1>` tag:

[source,html]
.grails-app/views/index.gsp
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/index.gsp[tags=header,indent=0]
----

We will be using this header to place the content received from the Server Sent Events.

Next add the following `<script>` block at the bottom of the page:

[source,html]
.grails-app/views/index.gsp
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/index.gsp[tags=eventSource,indent=0]
----

The JavaScript code above using the Server Sent Event specification's `EventSource` object to start receiving events from the controller:

[source,javascript]
.grails-app/views/index.gsp
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/index.gsp[tags=eventSourceObject,indent=0]
----

NOTE: You will need a http://caniuse.com/#feat=eventsource[modern browser] to use the `EventSource` object

It then registers a listner that will update the previously defined `<h2>` header with the response from the server:

[source,javascript]
.grails-app/views/index.gsp
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/index.gsp[tags=eventSourceListener,indent=0]
----

And that is it! You are now ready to run the application!
